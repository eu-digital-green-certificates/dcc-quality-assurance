# Handling of Special Cases

This repository contains some QR codes which special cases which needs special handling during the CBOR Decoding/JSON Processing. 


| Description| Occurence| Verifier Action | Issuer Action| QR Code|
|---------|----|----- |----|---|
| Whitespaces in decoded JSON fields| GR/EL QR Vaccination Codes in Field "mp" | During the CBOR Deserialization, all fields MUST be trimmed for whitespaces. | Issuers MUST trim for whitespace before issuing.
| Date of Birth with invalid pattern| BG QR Codes | If the schema is validated during the verifiying, the DOB regex should be ignored. Date/datetime formats should be ignored as well. | The generated QR Code should be deserialized after generation and checked against the schema. | <img src="https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dcc-quality-assurance/raw/main/BG/1.0.0/specialcases/VAC-NULL-DATETIME.png">
| Dates with invalid Pattern| BG QR Codes in dob field, PL codes in other date fields| Date/datetime formats should be ignored. |  The generated QR Code should be deserialized after generation and checked against the schema. |<img src="https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dcc-quality-assurance/blob/main/PL/1.0.0/specialcases/VAC-13.png?raw=true">
| t,v,r Entries have null values| BG QR Codes for v/t/r | Schema validation should check for ["null","array"]. "One of" should be ignored. | The generated QR Code should be deserialized after generation and checked against the schema. | <img src="https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dcc-quality-assurance/blob/main/BG/1.0.0/specialcases/VAC-NULL-DATETIME.png?raw=true">
| Negative doses| LV QR Code in Vaccination Certificate (not productive, Problem fixed) | Number of doses has in schema a min/max value. Verifiers should remove this limit to accept any kind of doses.| The generated QR Code should be deserialized after generation and checked against the schema.  
| "null/nil/undefined" values ommited| Several QR Codes. Problem occurs when the JSON schema is just used to generate Objects which are filled and serialized later without additional schema validation (JSON creation not performed). | All verifiers must should add to schema ["null",{DataType}] or remove null/undefined during the cbor deserialization.| All serializers which are used, must be configured/tested to avoid omitting null values to CBOR. A addtional schema validation can avoid this problem.  | <img src="https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dcc-quality-assurance/blob/main/LV/1.0.0/specialcases/TEST_NULL_values_in_nm_ma.png?raw=true">    
| Standardized Name fields (fnt/gnt) with special signs| Several QR Codes | Verifiers should remove pattern checks. Accept any string.| Issuer must strictly check for pattern after the serialization to CBOR. | <img src="https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dcc-quality-assurance/blob/b6664861b3bf2a982a6fe9776aa6992a76420e6e/NO/VAC.png?raw=true"/>
| Escaped characters in CBOR content| HU/UA QR Codes | Verifiers should escape " correctly with \\" otherwise the JSON parsing fails. | Issuers should avoid the usage of JSON special signs, because not all CBOR implementations deserialize directly. | <img src="https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dcc-quality-assurance/blob/main/HU/1.3.0/specialcases/TEST_RAT.png?raw=true">
