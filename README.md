## About

To automate the generation and validation tests of COSE/CBOR Codes and its base45/2D Code representations, a lot of data has to be collected to ensure the variance of the tests. This repository contains a curated selection of verified testdata. For testdata generated by member states that has not been curated and is open to ongoing contribution, please visit: https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-testdata.
